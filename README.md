**Abstract of Game Story**

In the far future, humanity has spread to the reaches of known space. There they encountered life forms, or rather we should call them a life form, who lived as a single entity. It pities all the life forms that have to live their lives alone and attempts to save them by bringing them into the fold. Of course, humanity is not willing to submit to the desires of the life form.
You are the commander of the static defense emplacements on the planet Earth. You have at your disposal the most advanced static defenses developed by Humanity to date. Defend the front lines and do not allow a single alien life form to slip through!

**Player Roles and action** 

•	It is the player’s role to place turrets in such a way that enemy units are destroyed before they can cross to the end of the map

•	Clicking on an empty square will place a turret if funds allow

•	Clicking on a turret gives the player the option to upgrade.

•	Upgrading the turret will change the appearance and damage of the turret

**Strategies and Motivation**

•	The player is given a limited amount of resources

•	For each turret placed the player loses resources

•	For each enemy unit destroyed the player gains resources

**Level Summary and Progression**

•	Enemies spawn if waves

•	If the player can stop all the waves on a map and still has health remaining, the player proceeds to the next map

•	If the player can finish all maps, the player wins the game
