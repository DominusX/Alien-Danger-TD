**1: Abstract of Game Story**

In the far future, humanity has spread to the reaches of known space. There they encountered life forms, or rather we should call them a life form, who lived as a single entity. It pities all the life forms that have to live their lives alone and attempts to save them by bringing them into the fold. Of course, humanity is not willing to submit to the desires of the life form.
You are the commander of the static defense emplacements on the planet Earth. You have at your disposal the most advanced static defenses developed by Humanity to date. Defend the front lines and do not allow a single alien life form to slip through!

•	The player must place turrets in such a way that enemy units are destroyed before they can reach to the end of the map

•	Clicking on a green circle-x will allow the player to place a turret if funds allow

•	Clicking on a turret gives the player the option to upgrade the damage output of the turret

•	Upgrading the turret will change the appearance and damage of the turret
